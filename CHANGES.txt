1.2 (2011-09-27)
================

- Make tests pass on Pyramid 1.2dev.

- Make compatible with Python 3.2 (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).

1.1 (2011-07-24)
================

- Add ``get_jinja2_environment`` directive.

- Add all configurator directives to documentation.

1.0 (2011-05-12)
================

- Message domain can now be specified with *jinja2.i18n.domain* for i18n

- Paster template now sets up starter locale pot/po/mo files

- pyramid_jinja2 now depends on Jinja2 >= 2.5.0 due to
  ``jinja2.Environment.install_gettext_callables`` use
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_jinja2/pull/21

- Added demo app just to visualize i18n work

0.6.2 (2011-04-06)
==================

- ``jinja2.ext.i18n`` is now added by default, see ``i18n.rst``
  for details

- Added ``add_jinja2_extension`` directive to the Configurator

- Updated jinja2.extensions parsing mechanism

- Fixed docs to indicate using asset: prefix is no longer necessary

0.6.1 (2011-03-03)
==================

- Asset-based loading now takes precedance and does not require
  "asset:" prefix

- Fixed the "current" package mechanism of asset: loading so that
  it more accurately finds the current package

- Dependency on ``pyramid_zcml`` removed.

0.6 (2011-02-15)
================

- Documentation overhauled.

- Templates can now be looked up by asset spec completely bypassing
  the search path by specifying a prefix of ``asset:``.

- Updated paster template to more closely relate to changes made
  to paster templmates in Pyramid core.

- Add new directive ``add_jinja2_search_path`` to the configurator
  when ``includeme`` is used.

0.5 (2011-01-18)
================

- Add ``includeme`` function (meant to be used via ``config.include``).

- Fix documentation bug related to ``paster create`` reported at
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_jinja2/issues#issue/12

- Depend upon Pyramid 1.0a10 + (to make ZCML work).

0.4 (2010-12-16)
================

Paster Template
---------------

- Changes to normalize with default templates shipping with Pyramid core:
  remove calls to ``config.begin()`` and ``config.end()`` from
  ``__init__.main``, entry point name changed to ``main``, entry
  ``__init__.py`` function name changed to ``main``, depend on WebError, use
  ``paster_plugins`` argument to setup function in setup.py, depend on
  Pyramid 1.0a6+ (use ``config`` rather than ``configurator``).

Tests
-----

- Use ``testing.setUp`` and ``testing.tearDown`` rather than constructing a
  Configurator (better fwd compat).

Features
--------

- Add ``model_url`` and ``route_url`` filter implementations (and
  documented).

Documentation
-------------

- Use Makefile which pulls in Pylons theme automagically.

0.3 (2010-11-26)
================

- Add ``jinja2.filters`` and ``jinja2.extensions`` settings (thanks to
  aodag).

- Document all known settings.

0.2 (2010-11-06)
================

- Template autoreloading did not function, even if ``reload_templates`` was
  set to ``True``.

0.1 (2010-11-05)
================

- First release.  *Not* backwards compatible with ``repoze.bfg.jinja2``: we
  use a filesystem loader (the directories to load from come from the
  ``jinja2.directories`` setting).  No attention is paid to the current
  package when resolving a renderer= line.
