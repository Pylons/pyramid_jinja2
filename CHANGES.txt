Next release
------------

0.3 (2010-11-26)
----------------

- Add ``jinja2.filters`` and ``jinja2.extensions`` settings (thanks to
  aodag).

- Document all known settings.

0.2 (2010-11-06)
----------------

- Template autoreloading did not function, even if ``reload_templates`` was
  set to ``True``.

0.1 (2010-11-05)
----------------

- First release.  *Not* backwards compatible with ``repoze.bfg.jinja2``: we
  use a filesystem loader (the directories to load from come from the
  ``jinja2.directories`` setting).  No attention is paid to the current
  package when resolving a renderer= line.
